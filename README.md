# Vagrantfiles
This project is used to help collect, organize and cleanup various ways I use vagrant across my projects.
It's purpose is to be the starting point for adding a Vagrantfile to any new project.  Essentially it's a collection
of the common patterms deployed througout different projects in a maintained versioned and usable form.
